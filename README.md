# Person CRUD WebAPI

## Description

This is a WebAPI developed in Java using the **Spring Boot** framework. The API allows performing **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a list of `Person` objects.

The application uses **DTOs** for data transfer and allows extracting information from both the URL and the request body.

## Features

The API provides the following functionalities:

1. **Create (POST)**: Adds a new `Person` object to the list.
2. **Read (GET)**: Retrieves data for one or more people.
4. **Update (PUT)**: Updates the age of a person.
5. **Delete (DELETE)**: Removes a person from the list.
